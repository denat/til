# Law of Triviality (Bikeshedding)

There's a tendency, especially in meetings with a large number of people, to give disproportionate weight to trivial, unimportant issues instead of the important ones. 

When gathered to discuss and voice opinions on issues, people will want to show that they are an active member of the team by giving their input. Complex issues tend to be neglected or addressed quickly without much discussion. Trivial issues on the other hand, due to being easier to comprehend, introduce a chance for everyone to demonstrate personal contribution, therefore resulting in dragged out discussions.
